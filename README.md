# Bullshit Button App

A simple front-end app containing a "Bullshit" button. Click it and it plays humorous irreverant random audio that will make most Australians, young people, or people with an immature sense of humour laugh.

The app is a Progressive Web App, so can be "installed" on a mobile phone via the web browser.
